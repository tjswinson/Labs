Journal Day 1
In the next 6 months I see myself having a better understanding of Web Development.
>  One year from now I see myself in a fulfilling career in Web development. 
>  I'm excited, scared and eager! I've stepped out of my comfort zone to do something totally different.
>  I hope to transition out the Accounting industry and into IT and I hope to teach coding one day.
>  I don't foresee any roadblocks as long as I stay focused.

> Git is a version control tool that allows you to perform all kinds of operations to fetch data from the central server. GitHub is a core hosting  platform for version control collaboration.
> Git tracks changes you make to your file, this is useful in case you have to refer to a previous version.
> GitHub allows you to share and collaborate with others.
> The payoff to using Git and GitHub is you're able to organize and make changes your projects all in one place.
