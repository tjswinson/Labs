Journal Day 1
In the next 6 months I see myself having a better understanding of Web Development.
>  One year from now I see myself in a fulfilling career in Web development. 
>  I'm excited, scared and eager! I've stepped out of my comfort zone to do something totally different.
>  I hope to transition out the Accounting industry and into IT and I hope to teach coding one day.
>  I don't foresee any roadblocks as long as I stay focused.
